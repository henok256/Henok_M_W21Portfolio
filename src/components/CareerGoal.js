            <p>After I graduate in Computer Programming and Analysis in the spring of 2021, I would like a job in Web Development. I have interests in working with front-end and Back-end web developments; thus, just as the field of Web Development is expansive, so are my interests. Therefore, the job that I pursue will be determined by both interest and the amount of my educational background I have; this is where my technical skills come in. I have also strong desire to work on cross platform mobile application.  In the coming three years, I want to establish a very concrete foundation in web-development and mobile application development, especially app developed by Java and Swift.  Nowadays it is hard to be competitive in technology industry without the understanding of Artificial Intelligence and machine Learning. because of this, I have a plan to lay strong foundation in machine learning and Artificial Intelligence especially in connection with web and mobile application in the next 5 years.
My career plan after 5 years is to be a full stack developer who has strong understanding in major web technologies, AI and Machine Learning.
